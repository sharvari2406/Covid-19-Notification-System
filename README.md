# Covid-19-Notification-System
As you all know, there are several cases of Coronavirus all over the world today. The number of cases are rising while some are also getting recovered. Thus to stay updated about what's going on in the world during this pandemic situation, i created a Covid-19 Notification System for my laptop (Windows 10). 
This Notification system will give you notifications after every 1 hour about the number of active cases in the world, recovered patients and number of deaths. Stay safe, take care!

Initially, before executing the project make sure that you have installed the following packages :
1. pip insall requests : sends requests to websites/fetch data from the websites
2. pip install win10toast : shows notifications in notifications are in Windows 10.
